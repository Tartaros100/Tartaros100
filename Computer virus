	<br><br><br>
	<p>Introduce:In the biological definition, a virus is a source of infection that replicates within the living cells of an organism and infects all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Although we are talking about computer "viruses", the reason why I am talking about viruses in biology here is that, first of all, the concept of computer "viruses" is extended from viruses. Indeed, computer "viruses" and viruses have many similarities, their biggest common point is the action of infection, but the object of infection is not the same, and these two viruses have a strong threat, they are malicious, destructive. And then we focus on all the computer "virus", we know that computer "virus" is a kind of malicious software, will destroy our computer, such as system failure, damage data, steal personal information and so on. Viruses can harm living organisms, while computer "viruses" can harm our computers. Powerful computer "viruses" can, like real super viruses, have a great impact on economic recession, government collapse, social unrest, etc. The above is my basic understanding of computer "viruses".In addition, I will continue to state my understanding and understanding of viruses from three aspects.<br><br>

	Future:In this section I will present my understanding of the future of computer "viruses". First of all, computer "viruses" will become more professional and more complex in the future, which means that it will be more difficult for us to fight against computer "viruses". Second, computer "viruses" in the future will definitely use the artificial intelligence we are familiar with to become more perfect and more powerful, and learn artificial intelligence at the same time. So that viruses can become as adaptive and self-learning as artificial intelligence. Nowadays, with the development of science and technology, we have born a concept called "Internet of things", such as smart homes, cars, etc., they make our lives more convenient, but we will certainly also be accompanied by some problems while enjoying convenience, since we call them "Internet of things", it must be related to the Internet. And the relationship with the Internet is bound to be related to the computer "virus" we talk about, a large number of the use of "Internet of things" will inevitably suffer from the computer "virus" caused by the trouble, but with the advancement of The Times, the use of "Internet of things" will only become deeper and deeper, which will become a major attack point of the virus in the future.<br><br>

	Transmission vector:As for the vectors of computer "virus", we commonly have some infected files (PDF,.doc), or the malicious spread of E-mail, and when people download something, they may download the virus and execute it without knowing it, and some removable storage media, such as hard disk, USB, etc., these are the ways of virus transmission. Our computer may be "infected" by "virus" because of some inadvertent actions, it may be just a small action that will make us have a huge loss.<br><br>

	How to prevent virus invasion:Prevention of virus intrusion is one of the important steps to protect our computer and protect our personal information and property in this era of technology. Usually, when we log in to the account, we will enter our password, which is a step to prevent virus intrusion. The use of some complex and special passwords will reduce the risk of virus intrusion to some extent. Combined with the results discussed above about computer "virus", we know that computer virus will damage our data and cause our system failure, so we can develop the habit of backing up data and updating our system in time, which will make our computer less likely to be "infected" and better protect our computer. At the same time, we should download safe and reliable software and information, and avoid using unverified software and websites.</p></center>
